 + Justification of whats is training and what is test
 + 
 + Model 1: Spliceformer only Human (Original Baseline)
 + Model 2/3/4: Human & 1 organism
 + Model 5: Human & all organisms
 + 
 + 
 + Training
   - house mouse
   - zebrafish
   - dog
   - trained specifically on splicing locations for specific genes present in all of the training organisms
 + Test
   - rat: gentically close to house mouse, it should perform well?
 + 
 + find the genes present in all training organisms
 + 
 + For all organisms: 
   - get gencode annotation
   - run through python notebook
   - get the set of all specific genes present in all organisms
   - trained on that set of specific genes, only when more than one organism present in training set

 + Task for reading week:
   + Everyone trains a model with Human & 1 organism
   + Maggie: zebrafish
   + Isla: house mouse
   + Carissa: dog or chimpanzee, you pick
 + 
 + Novel-knowledge is generating better annotation for splicing site
